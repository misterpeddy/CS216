<H3>How to Use the IBCM Simulator/Debugger Executables</H3>
<P>Reminder: be sure to read the <a href="ibcm-poo.pdf">IBCM Principles of Operation</a> and the 
<a href="ibcm-code-eg.pdf">IBCM code examples</a> for some very helpful hints 
about how to use the simulator effectively.&nbsp; You can also download the text 
file of the <a href="code-ex-1.txt">first</a> and <a href="code-ex-2.txt">second</a> 
IBCM example code.</P>
<P>Also see the IBCM lab.</P>

<P><B>Executable:</B> <A HREF="vb-ibcm.exe">vb-ibcm.exe</A> (runs if you have VB)<BR>
<B>Install: </B><A HREF="vb-ibcm-setup.exe">vb-ibcm-setup.exe</A> (use to install if you don't have VB) </P>

<P>1) If you are working in the ITC lab, then the simulator is installed already.  Run it from the menu:<I> Start-&gt;S.E.A.S.-&gt;IBCM
Simulator.</I>  It is also installed in Olsson 001 of course.</P>

<P>If you are working at home or on a machine that does not have it installed, try the following steps in order.</P>

<P>2) If you are working on a machine that has Visual Basic 6.0 installed (e.g. in the lab or in a public PC lab),
then click on the first link to get the smaller (44KB) file called <B>vb-ibcm.exe</B>. Try just double-clicking
to run this.  Or, if that fails or you want to have a copy on your machine's disk, then download this file to a
suitable directory (on a public machine this might be C:\LOCALDATA) and start Windows Explorer. Double-click on
the vb-ibcm.exe file and it will run the simulator.<BR>
<BR>
3) If step 2 fails, then click on the second link to get a larger (1.8 MB) file called <B>vb-ibcm-setup.exe</B>.
Create an empty directory and put this file in that, then double-click on it in Windows Explorer. The file is a
self-extracting archive that will now extract its component files. One of these files is called <B>setup.exe</B>;
double-click on it and IBCM will be installed on your computer. Then you can execute the simulator by double-clicking
on vb-ibcm.exe (which was part of the archive and is now on your disk), or you can find the IBCM program group
that has (hopefully) now been installed off your &quot;Start-&gt;Programs&quot; key on the lower left of your screen.<BR>
